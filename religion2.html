        <h2>Who is the full revelation of God?</h2>
        <p>
            The full revelation of God is Jesus because he is fully God and fully human. Jesus assumed a human nature at
            the time of the Incarnation.
            This means that Jesus took on the two qualities that make up a human being, body and soul. Christ
            experienced pain, emotions, death, and
            everything that goes along with being human. Besides being free from orginal sin Jesus' body is very
            similiar to ours.

        <h4>
            I Saw Jesus Today
        </h4>
        <p>
            I dont really see Jesus in my life, but I do know he is always here watching me. I imagine that Jesus sends
            a guardian angel to watch over me daily. But sometimes when I do a good deed for someone I think that Jesus
            is standing over me applauding because at times I can forget to think about other people.

            Faith Lived Out
        </h5>
        <p>
            I live my Faith out by praying at least five times a day to make up for not going to church. I also spend
            time serving my community by making cards for kids who are sick and the elderly. I spend time with my family
            and try to be helpful by doing any chores that need to be done.
        </p>

        <h6>
            How will I nurture my Faith?
        </h6>
        <p>
            I will countine to grow in my faith by loving and accepting everyone in my life. I will aplogize to anyone
            i've hurt in the past and tie up loose ends in some of my friendships. Also, if I see somebody I don't like,
            I do not have to be friends with them but I can at least say hello to them when if see them instead of being
            rude.

        Through daily prayer and reflection.

            How did you develop a strong faith?
        </p>
        By trusting in God's plan even though I might not always understand it and keeping faith that what happens is in
        God's will.
